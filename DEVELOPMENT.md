# Development Guide

## Testing

To run all tests, run the following command:

```sh
cargo +nightly test --all-features --all
```

### Expansion tests (`tests/expand`, `tests/expandtest.rs`)

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks
the code generated by macros.

To run this test, run the following command:

```sh
cargo +nightly test --all-features --test expandtest
```

Locally, this test updates the files in the `expand` directory if there are
changes to the generated code. If there are any changes to the files in the
`expand` directory after running the test, please commit them.

See also [`macrotest` documentation](https://docs.rs/macrotest).
